# Description: 
- In this project, I set out to improve fixed-income portfolio management by combining the Black-Litterman (BL) optimization framework with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), using the U.S. bond market as a case study. I constructed a diversified portfolio using 8 leading U.S. bond ETFs with various maturities. These ETFs were chosen to represent all the major sectors included in the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, ensuring realistic exposure to the full fixed-income universe.
- To address the challenge of changing market conditions, I trained a two-state Hidden Markov Model using weekly data from the equity volatility index and bond volatility index from 2003 to 2019. This allowed me to classify each week as either a “bull” (calm) or “bear” (volatile) regime and to forecast regime probabilities going forward. I then calculated expected returns for each ETF based on which regime was likely, and used these regime-based forecasts as dynamic investor views within the Black-Litterman optimisation process.
- Using this combined approach, I optimised the portfolio on a rolling weekly basis from 2020 to June 2025, accounting for realistic management and transaction costs. I compared the performance of this adaptive, regime-aware strategy to the passive approach of the portfolio without the use of Black-Litterman and a Black-Litterman scenario where future returns are assumed to be known beforehand. My results showed that the regime-based Black-Litterman strategy consistently outperformed both benchmarks, especially during volatile market periods, delivering higher risk-adjusted returns and smaller drawdowns. Although this method did require more frequent rebalancing, and thus incurred higher costs, the overall performance advantage more than compensated for these.
